# Changelog

All interface-affecting changes to `apexchainx-contracts` are recorded here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `get_config_version_hash` — deterministic hash of the current config snapshot for backend parity validation
- `get_result_schema` — explicit schema descriptor for SLA result encoding (status, payment type, rating symbols)
- `calculate_sla_view` — read-only simulation of SLA calculation without state mutation or auth requirement
- `get_config_snapshot` — ordered snapshot of all severity configs with version tag

### Changed
- `get_stats` now returns a `SLAStats` struct; callers should use field access rather than tuple destructuring
- History entries returned by `get_history` include `schema_version` for result envelope versioning

---

## [0.3.0] — Operator role and pause controls

### Added
- `set_operator` — admin-only function to update the operator address
- `pause` / `unpause` — admin-only controls; `calculate_sla` panics with `ContractPaused` when paused
- `get_operator` — read the current operator address

### Changed
- `calculate_sla` now requires the `operator` address as the first argument (breaking)
- `SLAError` extended with `ContractPaused = 6`

---

## [0.2.0] — Statistics and history

### Added
- `get_stats` — cumulative totals for calculations, violations, rewards, penalties
- `get_history` — ordered log of recent SLA calculation results
- `prune_history` — admin-only compaction to bound on-chain storage

---

## [0.1.0] — Initial contract surface

### Added
- `initialize(admin, operator)` — one-time setup; stores roles and default severity configs
- `set_config(caller, severity, threshold_minutes, penalty_per_minute, reward_base)` — admin-only config update
- `get_config(severity)` — read a single severity config
- `calculate_sla(caller, outage_id, severity, mttr_minutes)` — operator-gated SLA calculation

---

## Changelog Process

When making an interface-affecting change:

1. Add an entry under `[Unreleased]` in the appropriate section (`Added`, `Changed`, `Removed`, `Fixed`)
2. Use the exact function name as it appears in the contract
3. Mark breaking changes explicitly with **(breaking)**
4. On release, rename `[Unreleased]` to the version tag and date, then open a new `[Unreleased]` block
